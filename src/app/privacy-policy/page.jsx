              Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format our

              opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate the
              number or type of messages sent to our customers. Web beacons are
              small graphic images or other web programming code inserted into a
              web page or email that count visitors to the Website, monitor how
              users navigate the Website, count how many emails that were sent
              are actually opened, or count how many particular articles or
              links were actually viewed. Certain mobile service providers
              uniquely identify mobile devices, and we, or our third-party
              service providers, may receive such device information if you
              access the Website through mobile devices. Certain features of our
              Website may require the collection of mobile phone numbers, and we

              information. An embedded script is programming code designed to
              collect information about your interactions with the Website, such

              As is true of most Websites, we gather some information

              IP addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider
              (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time
              stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand

              on the site, and gather demographic information about our user
              base as a whole. Reliavet may use this information in our

              In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked
              to our websited&apos;s content. When customers click one of these URLs,
              they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the
              destination page on our Website. We track this click-through data
              to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the
              effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer to
              avoid being tracked this way, you should not click text or graphic
              links in the email messages.

              Reliavet and its partners may use cookies and other technologies

              measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to
