              Reliavet&apos;s policy is to respond to claims of copyright
              infringement. We will promptly process and investigate notices of
              alleged infringement by third parties. We will take appropriate
              actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17,
              United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) (the "DMCA"), where
              applicable. <br /> <br /> Pursuant to the DMCA, notifications of
              claimed copyright infringement by third parties should be sent to
              Reliavet&apos;s Designated Agent. If you believe your copyrighted
              work has been infringed under U.S. copyright law and is accessible
              on this Site, please notify us by contacting our Designated Agent.
              Even if you believe a third party did not post the alleged

              copyright infringement to Reliavet&apos;s Designated Agent listed
              below.
